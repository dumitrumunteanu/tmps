# Command

---

The command design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables the separation of an object's interface from its implementation. This allows for the creation of objects that represent actions or operations, which can then be executed or invoked at a later time.

In a car theme, the command design pattern could be used to create objects that represent actions such as accelerating, braking, or turning. These objects could then be executed by a car object to perform the desired action.

Here is my implementation of the command design pattern:

First, we can define an interface for the command objects, which will specify the method that must be implemented by all command objects:
```java
public interface Command {
  void execute();
}
```

Next, we can define concrete command classes that implement the Command interface and perform the desired action when the execute() method is called. For example, here is a BrakeCommand class that represents the action of applying the brakes:
```java
public class BrakeCommand implements Command {

  // reference to the car object that the command will be executed on
  private Car car;

  public BrakeCommand(Car car) {
    this.car = car;
  }

  @Override
  public void execute() {
    car.brake();
  }
}
```
We can define similar command classes for other actions such as accelerating and turning (this is not implemented, it is just an idea).

Finally, we can create a Car class that has a method for executing a Command object:
```java
public class Car {

  // other car attributes and methods

  public void executeCommand(Command command) {
    command.execute();
  }
}
```

With this implementation, we can create command objects and pass them to the Car object, which will execute the desired action when the executeCommand() method is called. For example:
```java
Car myCar = new Car();

// create a brake command
Command brakeCommand = new BrakeCommand(myCar);

// execute the brake command
myCar.executeCommand(brakeCommand);
```
This is just a simple example of how the command design pattern can be used in a car theme. In a real-world implementation, there may be additional complexity and more sophisticated uses of the pattern.
